#Door Prefab Script
#------------------

#This is a generic door. It is not bound to any particular opening
#condition, it could open based on anything (does he have a key?
#is he moving fast? has some time elapsed? is some switch somewhere
#on? etc.).

#The non-SlidingBrush properties are as follows:-
#
# repeat    - Whether the door can be opened multiple times
#
# condition - The Python code condition which is checked. It
#             must evaluate to a True/False value.
#
# autoClose - Whether the door closes automatically after a
#             a delay after opening.

#The 'condition' code is run in collide-function scope. An example
#condition is, "other.hasFlag("Player")".
